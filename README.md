# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project Documentation

Welcome!  
This README explains everything about this repository, which contains the documentation for the **Airbnb Clone** project.

The goal of this documentation is to outline the **core features** and **backend functionality** required to make the Airbnb Clone work efficiently, be user-friendly, and support key operations like property listings, user management, bookings, and payments.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This is an Airbnb Clone project built to simulate how rental listings work online. Just like the real Airbnb platform, this web app lets:

- 🧑‍💻 Users (Guests) register and rent properties for a period of time at a cost.
- 🏘️ Other users (Hosts) list their properties so they can be rented out.

The web app is meant to mirror the key actions and logic behind property rental marketplaces — from login and listing to booking and payments.

##  Features and Functionalities Directory

Inside the `features-and-functionalities/` folder, you'll find a **airbnb_features.png** that visually breaks down all the main features of the Airbnb Clone backend system.

This is a high-level feature overview focused only on **functionality** for now. Technical details (e.g., APIs, database schema) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security) will be added in later versions of this documentation.
